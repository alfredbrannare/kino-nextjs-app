## Motivation for choosing Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI

- In the development of our project, we chose to use Tailwind Css in combination
  with DaisyUI as our UI framework. This decision is based on:

- Fast and flexible development Tailwind allows for rapid and responsive design.
  It removes the need to write traditional CSS, speeding up the development
  process and simplifying code maintenance.

- Consistent design with less code Tailwind enables a consistent design system
  using utility classes. This allows us to create intuitive reusable and easy to
  modifiable UI components without reinventing styles for each element.

- DaisyUI - DaisyUI has a component-based UI kit, it is a plugin for Tailwind
  that provides pre-designed, clean and accessible UI components such as
  buttons, modals, cards, tables and more, fully compatible with Tailwindâ€™s
  utility classes and are easy to customize.

- Active community support - Both Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI have large, active
  communities and strong documentation. This made it easier for us to onboard
  and find solutions and best practices

### Instructions for Using the Auth Context

Import the useAuth Hook First, import the useAuth hook in your component:

    import { useAuth } from "src/components/user/AuthData";

Destructure Auth Data Then, use the useAuth hook to get the user data,
authentication status, loading state, and other necessary values:

    const { userData, isLoggedIn, isLoading, logout, login, isAdmin, token } = useAuth();

Now, you can use these values throughout your component as needed!

### Example: Protecting Pages for Logged-in Users

If you want to protect specific pages so that only logged-in users can access
them, you can implement a simple check using the useAuth hook and useEffect:

    import { useAuth } from "src/components/user/AuthData";
    import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
    import { useEffect } from "react";

    const { userData, isLoggedIn, isLoading, logout, isAdmin } = useAuth();
    const router = useRouter();

    useEffect(() => {
      if (!isLoading && !isLoggedIn) {
       router.push("/"); // Redirect to the home page if the user is not logged in
      }
    }, [isLoggedIn, isLoading, router]);

    if (isLoading) return <p>Loading page data...</p>;
    if (!isLoggedIn) return <p>Access Denied. You are not authorized to view this page.</p>;

### Example: Backend Token Validation

On the backend, you can check the user's token to validate their authentication.
Here's how you might check the token:

    import { checkAuth } from "src/lib/auth";
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server"; // Import NextResponse

    const authenticatedUser = await checkAuth(req);
       if (!authenticatedUser) {
         return NextResponse.json({ message: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
       }

      // Optionally, check if the user is an admin
     const isAdmin = authenticatedUser.role.includes('admin');
       if (!isAdmin) {
        return NextResponse.json(
         { message: "You don't have the right to use this feature!" },
         { status: 403 }
        );
      }

### Example: Hiding Components Based on Login Status

You can also conditionally render components based on whether the user is logged
in. Here's an example of how to hide or show content depending on the login
status:

    const { isLoggedIn, isLoading } = useAuth();
    {!isLoggedIn ? (
      <p>Show this data to non-logged-in users</p>
       ) : (
      <p>Hide this data for logged-in users</p>
     )}

## Auditoriums API

### Overview
Auditoriums represent the different cinema halls available for movie screenings.

Each auditorium has a unique `slug` and a complete seat layout, including any wheelchair-accessible seats.

Each seat may optionally include the boolean field `"isWheelchair": true` to indicate accessibility. These seats are visually distinguished with a blue square/seat in the frontend.

This information is used for rendering the seat selector and validating bookings.

Auditoriums are stored as documents in the MongoDB database and can be added manually.

### GET `/api/auditoriums/[slug]`

**Method:** `GET`

**Description:** Fetches auditorium data including seat layout based on the given slug.
Used by the booking system to render available seats in the correct layout.

**URL Parameters:**

- `slug` (required): The unique identifier for the auditorium (e.g. `city`,
  `grand`)

**Example Auditorium Documents:**

```json
{
  "name": "Uppsala City",
  "capacity": 58,
  "seats": [
    { "row": 1, "seat": 1 },
    { "row": 1, "seat": 2 },
    { "row": 1, "seat": 3 },
    ...
    { "row": 8, "seat": 10, "isWheelchair": true }
  ],
  "slug": "city"
}


```
```json

```

**Error Responses:**

- `400 Bad Request`: If any required field is missing
- `403 Forbidden`: If member tickets are selected but the user is not logged in
- `409 Conflict`: If one or more seats are already booked

---

### Example: Booking as a Logged-In Member

**Scenario:**  
A logged-in user opens a screening and selects _Medlem_ tickets. All other
ticket types are hidden.  
When submitting the booking, the request is automatically linked to the
authenticated user.

#### Requirements

- The user must be logged in via the `<Login />` component
- `useAuth()` provides access to the user's `isLoggedIn` and `userData`
- The booking request must include at least one member ticket

#### Booking Flow

1. User selects **only** member tickets in `TicketSelector.jsx`
2. All other ticket types are automatically set to `0` on login
3. On submit, the frontend sends a `POST /api/bookings` with
   `ticketInfo.member > 0`
4. The backend:
   - Extracts the `userId` via JWT with `checkAuth()`
   - Rejects the request if the user is not logged in
   - Saves the booking and links it to the authenticated user
   - Adds the booking ID to the correct `Screening` via `$push`

#### Example Payload (simplified):

```json
{
  "movieId": "...",
  "screeningTime": "...",
  "auditorium": "city",
  "seats": [{ "row": 1, "seat": 4 }],
  "ticketInfo": {
    "ordinary": 0,
    "child": 0,
    "retired": 0,
    "student": 0,
    "member": 1
  }
}
```

---

### Booking â†’ Screening Mapping (Server-side)

When a booking is made, the backend also:

- Converts the provided `auditorium` slug into an `_id` using the `Auditorium`
  model
- Finds the matching `Screening` document using `movieId`, `startTime`, and
  `auditoriumId`
- Pushes the new bookingâ€™s `_id` into the screeningâ€™s `bookedSeats` array:

```js
Screening.findOneAndUpdate(
  {
    movieId,
    startTime: new Date(screeningTime),
    auditoriumId: auditoriumDoc._id,
  },
  {
    $push: { bookedSeats: booking._id },
  },
);
```

This ensures that:

- Booked seats are correctly linked to their screening
- Future requests can show which seats are taken for each showtime

---

This Cypress E2E test verifies the behavior of the Tickets page when displaying movies and their screenings.
The test performs the following:

- Mocks a successful API response with two test movies. One with a screening and one without any screenings.
- Visits the /tickets page and confirms: (1) The page title "Biljetter" is visible. (2) Movie details (title, runtime, genre, description) are correctly displayed. (3) Screenings are shown for movies that have them. (4) A fallback message is shown for movies without screenings.
- Mocks a failed API response (500) and confirms that an error message is displayed to the user.

### API Unit/Integration Tests (Jest)

These tests cover the API route handlers. To run the following tests:

1. In the project root, start the MongoDB service: `docker-compose up -d mongo`.
2. Run Tests: `npm run test`
3. Stop mongoDB server: `docker stop mongo_kino_test`


### A Deployment:

- The short backstory:
A long time ago in our first courses when We still didnâ€™t understand what Express was, we came across Render.com and created a small API route where we got our first response in JSON.

- Nowadays:
The service is basically a website connected to GitHub that provides users with a free slice of server time which shuts down after 15 minutes of inactivity.
Render service itself is very flexible and easy to scale.
From the very beginning we deployed the site to production so we could monitor it during development and ensure it worked without errors â€” and it did that perfectly!
After every commit it automatically detects that the site needs to be rebuilt and runs npm run build, run and install. It also provides a convenient and secure environment for environment variables.
It might be a bit pricey but our database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas and so far that has been enough for us.
